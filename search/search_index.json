With E.164 formatting, this '0' must usually be removed. For example, here\u2019s a UK-based number in standard local formatting: 020 7183 8750 Here\u2019s the same phone number in E.164 formatting: +442071838750 Custom formatting Sometimes the phone number has footprints but is used with a different formatting. This is a problem because for example if we search for \"+15417543010\", we'll not find web pages that write it that way : \"(541) 754\u20133010\". So the tool use a (optional) custom formatting given by the user to find further and more accurate results. To use this feature properly and make the results more valuable, try to use a format that someone of the number' country would usually use to share the phone number online. For example, French people usually write numbers that way online : 06.20.30.40.50 or 06 20 30 40 50 . For US-based numbers, the most common format is : 543-456-1234 . Examples Here are some examples of custom formatting for US-based phone numbers : +1 618-555-xxxx (+1)618-555-xxxx +1/618-555-xxxx (618) 555xxxx (618) 555-xxxx (618) 555.xxxx (618)555xxxx (618)555-xxxx (618)555.xxxx For European countries (France as example) : +3301 86 48 xx xx +33018648xxxx +33018 648 xxx x (0033)018648xxxx (+33)018 648 xxx x +33/018648xxxx (0033)018 648 xxx x +33018-648-xxx-x (+33)018648xxxx (+33)01 86 48 xx xx +33/018-648-xxx-x +33/01-86-48-xx-xx +3301-86-48-xx-xx (0033)01 86 48 xx xx +33/01 86 48 xx xx (+33)018-648-xxx-x (+33)01-86-48-xx-xx (0033)01-86-48-xx-xx (0033)018-648-xxx-x +33/018 648 xxx x Local scan formatting (developers) The local scan create several variables to be usable in OSINT footprinting and other scanners.
